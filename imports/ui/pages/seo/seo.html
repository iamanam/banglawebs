                        Search engine optimization used to be a simple process. Just add a few metatag keywords to
                        your site and you were good to go! Over time, web site owners – and their developers –
                        started abusing the system and search engines had to adjust their algorithms to generate
                        more relevant search engine results. Metatag keywords are no longer useful. In fact, Google
                        has ignored them for about ten years! Today, search engines reward web sites that have
                        relevant content, have good usability and are highly visible on the internet.

                        One sure-fire way of getting your site to the top of the search engine rankings is to pay

                        sometimes a pay-per-click advertising campaign is the right solution for a business. We
                        manage numerous pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns for our clients. You can
